go through and fix FIXME's
reduce turning at faster speeds.
make some images?
actually test bubble stuff
handle going off of the edge
make sure rotations work as they should
make ship and user lists reuse free'd spots (maybe do this after making sure everything handles ships that no longer exist. would simplify it extremely)
make sure everything can handle ships that no longer exist/are different now
