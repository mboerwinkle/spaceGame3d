make slow test to make sure that every ship is either in a bubble or an orphan
some things in /shared include /def.h. This means that /client build depends on /def.h which should not be true.
make common reversed quaternion functions faster
used signedPoint everywhere where I cobbled together a solution to avoid signage problems
make packets that are split up have a "is not the last packet" notifier at the end of non-last packets. Worst case if last packet gets dropped is two frames get mashed together.
go through and fix FIXME's
send rotations as floats to client (save 16 bytes per ship)
reduce turning at faster speeds.
actually test bubble stuff
handle going off of the edge
make ship and user lists reuse free'd spots (maybe do this after making sure everything handles ships that no longer exist. would simplify it extremely)
make sure everything can handle ships that no longer exist/are different now
have client check for END at the end of messages

Good ship AI (codify common dogfighting procedures... would be pretty sweet if I used named wwII tactics)
Collision detection/handling (big and small)
Overarching AI
Slow Vision Bullets/Vision Lasers
Missiles
